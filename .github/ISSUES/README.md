This folder contains prepared issue descriptions that reflect missing features compared to the reference project (Gymie).

How to use
- Install GitHub CLI (`gh`) and authenticate: `gh auth login`.
- Run `scripts/create_github_issues.sh` to create the issues in this repository (it will read files in this folder).

Files are named with a numeric prefix to indicate priority. Edit any file to adjust title/body before creating issues.
